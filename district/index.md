I have lived in Eau Claire for 15 years – from the eastside hill, to the dorms of UW-Eau Claire, to my home of 8 years in the Third Ward. District 3 encompasses the Third Ward, UWEC, Putnam Heights/Southside (west of State Street), and the Eastside Hill (south of Altoona Ave and east of Lee Street). See a map of District 3 below or <a href="/img/Ald_WardPlanApproved_Dec2017.pdf">download a PDF of Eau Claire's Aldermanic Districts.</a>

I am passionate about the future of the district, and cognisant of the many issues we face to maintain and improve quality of life in our neighborhoods. In just the last few years we have lost two grocery stores critical to our neighborhoods, Mega East on the Eastside Hill, and Gordy’s at Shopko Plaza. Expansion plans for Just Local Food Cooperative could result in a move out of the Third Ward, leaving us without a grocery store. This is just one example of an issue that should have the attention of a district city council member. 

**I want to hear what issues you face**, and how you feel the city can help. I am ready to respond to the needs of citizens as a city council member. <a href="mailto:gragertforcitycouncil@gmail.com">Please email me</a> and let me know what issues are important to you!
