<img src="/img/jeremy_bike.jpg">

I was born in Minneapolis but grew up in Stillwater, Minnesota, where I gained an appreciation for history and conservation of natural resources, living just blocks from the historic downtown and the Saint Croix River. 

I moved to Eau Claire in 2000 to attend UW-Eau Claire, where I became active both on and off campus in important issues facing our community. I currently live in the Third Ward in my home of 8 years, but over the years have also lived in the Historic Randall Park Neighborhood, the Eastside Hill, and in the dorms of UW-Eau Claire. I’m passionate about bicycling, environmental stewardship, local history, photography, and live music.
