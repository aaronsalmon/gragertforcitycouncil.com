### Yard Signs

Yard signs are one way to get my name out to the community, and for voters to show their support! If you’d like a yard sign just send us your residential address and we’ll deliver one once they are printed, sometime closer to the election. Addresses within District 3 will be given priority. Request a yard sign by <a href="mailto:gragertforcitycouncil@gmail.com">sending me an email</a>.
