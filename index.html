      <p>Working to make Eau Claire a better place to live has been a passion of mine for the last 15 years, and I have had the pleasure of organizing alongside so many of my fellow citizens to help get us to where we are today. I feel Iâ€™ve become a leader who listens and acts upon the ambitions of this community, and I have a track record of helping citizens get involved and make a difference.</p>

      <p>Through advocacy and hard work I helped to create the <a target="_blank" href="https://volumeone.org/articles/2015/08/04/10537_wheely_useful">Chippewa Valley Bike Map</a> (2015), the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eauclairewi.gov/government/boards-commissions-committees/view-all/advisory-commission-on-sustainability">City of Eau Claire Sustainability Advisory Committee</a> (2014), and expanded community gardens and bike and walking trails throughout the city. We are now a state leader in clean energy.</p>

      <p>I could not have done this alone, but by working in cooperation with the city and with as many citizens as possible, we have been successful. As a council member, I will make city government even more inclusive and welcoming of civic participation.</p>

      <p>I will be working hard to earn your vote for Eau Claire City Council on Tuesday, April 3rd!</p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>
    </h3>
