      <p>Working to make Eau Claire a better place to live has been a passion of mine for the last 18 years. I have had the pleasure of organizing alongside many great people who’ve helped get us to where we are today. I feel I’ve become a leader who listens and acts upon the ambitions of this community, and I have a track record of helping citizens get involved and make a difference.</p>

      <p>A member of City Council since 2018, I am dedicated to District 3, and I have never missed a City Council meeting or a vote. I have also worked to make sure that more people have a voice in our local government, by supporting the creation of the public comment period at all City Council meetings, and at boards, committees, and commissions.</p>

      <p>Before joining the City Council, I helped to create the <a target="_blank" href="https://volumeone.org/articles/2015/08/04/10537_wheely_useful">Chippewa Valley Bike Map</a> (2015), the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eauclairewi.gov/government/boards-commissions-committees/view-all/advisory-commission-on-sustainability">City of Eau Claire Sustainability Advisory Committee</a> (2014), and expanded community gardens and bike and walking trails throughout the city. Since joining City Council I have worked toward a more affordable and vibrant Eau Claire by focusing on housing, transportation, and moving toward 100% renewable ener</p>

      <p>I would appreciate your vote for re-election to the Eau Claire City Council on Tuesday, April 6th!</p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>
    </h3>
